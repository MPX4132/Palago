                    <h1>Rules</h1>
                <p>Two players, White and Blue, share a common pool of 48 hexagonal Palago tiles. Each tile contains a straight and a circular tip of each colour, and may be oriented in three ways such that edge colours always match.</p>
                <p>White places two adjacent tiles in the playing area, such that edge colours match. </p>
                <p>Players then take turns adding two adjacent tiles, such that at least one touches an existing tile and all edge colours match. Both tiles must be played unless the first tile wins the game. </p>
                <p>The game is won by the player to form a creature (closed group) of their colour with at least one straight. Only one tile need be played if that tile wins the game for either player.</p>
                <p>If a move simultaneously completes winning creatures for both players then the mover loses. If the tiles run out before either player wins then the game is a draw.</p>
